<strong>MODELS</strong> is the premier conference series for model-based software and systems engineering which since 1998 has been covering all aspects of modeling, from languages and methods to tools and applications.

</p>

<p class="text-justify">
MODELS 2018 will be held at IT University of Copenhagen, in Denmark. MODELS 2018 invites the modeling community to contribute to and extend the foundations and successful applications of modeling in areas such as business information and embedded systems, but also by exploring the use of modeling for new and emerging systems, paradigms, and challenges including cyber-physical systems, cloud computing, services, social media, security, and open source. 
We invite authors from all over the world to submit and join us in Copenhagen for MODELS 2018.

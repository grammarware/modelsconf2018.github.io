# Call for Doctoral Symposium

The goal of the MODELS 2018 Doctoral Symposium is to provide an international forum for doctoral students to interact with their fellow students and faculty mentors working in the area of model-driven engineering. The symposium supports students by providing independent and constructive feedback about their already completed and, more importantly, planned research work. The Symposium will be attended by prominent experts in the field of model-driven engineering, who will actively participate in critical and constructive discussions.

The doctoral symposium will have the format of a one-day workshop, with presentations of the doctoral students who have their paper accepted in a peer-review process, feedback from the mentors, and plenty of time for discussion. The presentations will be open for mentors, students, and other conference participants; only supervisors of the presenters are excluded from the sessions in which their students deliver their presentation.

## Submission Guidelines

Submissions (exclusively authored by the doctoral student) are invited from students who have settled on a doctoral dissertation topic, but are still sufficiently far away from completion to be able to take full advantage of the given feedback. 

Submissions should present research in progress that is intended to lead to a doctoral dissertation, using the following structure:


* Problem: The problem the research intends to solve, the target audience of this research, and a motivation of why the problem is important and needs to be solved.
* Related work: A review of the relevant related work, with an emphasis on how the proposed approach is different and what advantages it has over the existing state of the art.
* Proposed solution: A description of the proposed solution and which other work (e.g., methods or tools) it depends on.
* Plan for evaluation and validation: A description of how it will be shown that the work does indeed solve the targeted problem and is superior to the existing state of the art (e.g., prototyping, industry case studies, user studies, experiments).
* Expected contributions: A list of the expected contributions to both theory and practice.
* Current status: A description of the work to-date, results achieved so far and a proposed planned timeline for completion.

Submissions must not exceed five (5) pages plus two (2) pages for references. All submissions must conform to the Springer LNCS style (http://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines).

All papers have to be submitted electronically in PDF format via Easychair: <Link here>
